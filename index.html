<a>
  Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
  kicking a ball to score a goal. <br />
  Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is
  the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football
  include association football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland
  and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or
  Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby
  league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share, to
  varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".

Best football players in the world 2023
Our round-up of the best football players in the world right now.
Play Video
10. Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid)
Some might say it's a season too soon to include him on this list of behemoths, but Bellingham has already shown enough to convince the world of his obscene talent at Dortmund and on the international stage.

Bellingham's all-action, dynamic presence saw him transform from teenage wildcard to instant starter for England at the World Cup 2022 and his displays for Dortmund put them firmly in title contention against the Bayern Munich juggernaut, spurned only by goal difference.

He is the complete package in midfield already. Physically imposing, an immense ball carrier, with precision passing skills, Bellingham will soar in 2023/24, buoyed by enough confidence to claim Zinedine Zidane's No.5 shirt at the Bernaodricbeu.

9. Luka Modric (Real Madrid)
Ageless, timeless, majestic. Modric will never get old nor will he retire – we simply refuse to believe it. We are 20 years on from Modric's professional debut with Zrinjski Mostar in the Bosnian Premier League, more than 800 games into his career, and there are still few players you'd trust more to pull the strings in midfield.

Modric is silk personified. He never looks troubled or over-exerted, he is butter-smooth. A deft touch, a little drop of the shoulder to purchase space an unstoppable artful pass designed to slit through the lines. We've all seen it, the opponents he is facing have all seen it before too, but nobody can do anything about it.

The 37-year-old should be in decline, he should be losing his legs and unpredictability should be creeping in, but Madrid's management of his minutes has been sublime. He will be fit and fresh for those enormous Champions League nights. And he'll just keep running the show until his curtain call.

8. Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid)
We promise this isn't just a Real Madrid XI, but it's an ominous sign for the rest of the football world that while the capital snake has shed some of its ageing skin in recent transfer windows, an equally venomous threat is slithering into the open, a team led by Vini Jr.

The 23-year-old has already racked up more than 200 appearances for the club in all competitions since 2018, and he is one of the few contenders who could, without a hint of delusion, claim to be sitting top of this list in several years time.

Vincius' pace is scorching, with dynamite acceleration able to propel himself from standing starts beyond petrified defenders at will. Most impressively, he harnesses that speed with quickness of feet and ball control to match any player in the world.

7. Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona)
Goals, goals, goals. In a decade of false nines, inside forwards, inverted thingamajigs, Lewandowski has relentlessly flown the flag for natural out-and-out strikers.

In many ways, Lewandowski is a no-nonsense entity. He knows where the ball will flow, he knows the positions to be in and when to be there, he knows all the measurements of the goal frame and will use every inch of it to ripple the net. If the ball falls to one player in a one-on-one situation in world football, Lewandowski is both the most likely player to be in that position and the man you'd want to be there.

Lewandowski is very able when it comes to building attacks and creating chances, but his movement and awareness as the target for others to find means he is at his most ruthless hovering around at the very top end of the pitch.

6. Karim Benzema (Al-Ittihad)
It would be tempting to say Karim Benzema enjoyed the ultimate Indian summer in 2022/23 but in reality, he simply did what he has always done: lead the line, score goals, win trophies, repeat.

Everything Real Madrid have achieved in the last 14 years has been achieved under Benzema's watch. He has not always been treated with respect, Real Madrid have tried to replace him with plenty of strikers over the last decade, but nobody has been able to fill the No.9 role quite like him.

Benzema gets through a remarkable amount of dirty work in 90 minutes. He digs deep and acts as a wide/inside forward's dream, the ultimate pivot point to build attacks around. Benzema is happy playing with his back to goal and that often proves just as dangerous to opponents as bearing down on them directly. Play a 'one', make a darting run and you'll always receive the 'two'. He is a complete striker who finally received the praise his play deserved before exiting for Saudi Arabia.

5. Erling Haaland (Man City)
Haaland has normalised the abnormal. Arguably, the Norse titan's only flaw in 2022/23 was setting the bar insurmountably high from the very start. Between the start of the season and the end of 2022, Haaland found the net 22 times in just 15 Premier League games. For context, that total would have won the Golden Boot in seven Premier League seasons. He cooled off slightly after Christmas, but still played at an extraordinary level.

His physicality is unrivalled, his finishing ability – including improvised, instinctive finishing by any means necessary – is staggering and he boasts a turn of pace that few in the Premier League could match. The best bit? We're mostly likely yet to see Haaland at his absolute peak. The next few years should be explosive and if he proves his consistency over several years, he will sit No.1 in this list without a doubt.

4. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)
The relative mystique of foreign leagues can often inflate a player's reputation as we are fed their many highlights and rarely see their 4/10s, the days they'd rather not remember, their misses and their failures. The Premier League, in all its hyper-exposed, tribal glory, is often not a place where rival fans can appreciate world class talent when they see it. It feels like in 2023, we finally hit that peak with Kane. And then he left. For a foreign league.

Kane's season-end tallies remain consistent around the 30-goal mark with a bundle of assists and uncountable contributions setting him above almost every other striker in the world.

His finishing is exemplary, his positioning to accommodate for a lack of raw pace is second-to-none, though his unique selling point is his uncanny playmaking ability, to pick a pass from deep, to swing a cross in, to play the No.10 and No.9 roles simultaneously and effectively and he achieved all of that in a team that, with the greatest respect, was simply not at his level and rarely has been near his standard. He is deadly for club and country, and started life in Munich without skipping a beat.

3. Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)
Kevin De Bruyne appeared to have a relatively lukewarm season in 2022/23... but still created 22 goals and scored nine in 42 matches across the Premier League and Champions League combined. Injury issues have seen the Belgian fail to dominate our screens as often as he has done in the past, but like Haaland, he has made extraordinary achievements seem, well, ordinary.

KDB could be the greatest crosser of a ball in Premier League history, while his vision and penchant for a defence-splitting pass combine with frightening effectiveness on a number of occasions.

One of the best aspects of De Bruyne is that he comes with all the trimmings. He's a lethal set-piece taker, he is unexpectedly physical and genuinely quick off the mark. Without these things, KDB would remain a top, top player, but with them at his disposal, he is a multi-layered box of tricks.

2. Kylian Mbappé (PSG)
Mbappé is a megastar forged by the crucible of the World Cup. It's an old-school way to achieve greatness given the prominence of the Champions League and Premier League, but Mbappé's international heroics prove his ability and mentality beyond all reasonable doubt.

Like Neymar, like many before, he has made a mockery of Ligue 1 but his form on the global stage for both club and country puts him out in front. His World Cup final hat-trick will go down as the stuff of legends – a big time performance from a big time player.

Mbappé is often portrayed as a dramatic soap character in the ever-brewing psychodrama between PSG and Real Madrid, a large portion of his mind fixed on off-field politics, but the character he showed throughout the World Cup, his mentality and steely determination to drag his team kicking and screaming to the trophy has elevated him up another notch on the ladder.

He is one of the fastest footballers we've ever seen grace the field, with a range of shooting like no other. He can strike the ball on the run or with immense power from a dead standing start, he can finesse shots low into the corners and drill the ball high and rising into the roof of the net. If Mbappé has the ball in your half, you are not safe.

1. Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)
For the first time in over a decade, we sincerely had to ponder our No.1 selection but in the spirit of VAR, we found no clear and obvious reason to rule out Messi from the summit.

There's no denying Messi has evolved. He has lost a fraction of his blistering pace but his intelligence and manipulation of the football means his control over the result of games remains as strong as ever. He is not an all-action terrier, he won't pitch in with too much dirty work, but to count that against him is to miss the point entirely.

Messi continues to dominate games – both subtly and explicitly – for club and country. His performances directly inspired Argentina to Copa America and World Cup trophies, and has transformed rock bottom MLS team, Inter Miami, into cup finalists in the space of a month.

Messi's time at the top will come to an end, very conceivably soon, but for now, we can't find a justification to drop a player with such talent, such influence and impact, with such recent success and fuel left in the tank. The magician reigns supreme.
